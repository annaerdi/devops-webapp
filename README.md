## Project Overview

objectives:

- [x] **Create Dockerfile:** a multi-stage Dockerfile was created to build and containerize the web application.
- [x] **Set up CI/CD Pipeline:**
    - [x] Linting: Runs on every push to any branch.
    - [x] Building: Runs on every push to any branch.
    - [x] Auditing: Runs only on merges to the `main` or `release` branches.
- [x] **Push Docker Image to Docker Hub:** The Docker image has been successfully pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/erna67/devops-webapp).
- [ ] **Deploy on Azure Container Apps**

## Docker Image

The Docker image for this project is available on Docker Hub:

- **Repository:** [erna67/devops-webapp](https://hub.docker.com/r/erna67/devops-webapp)
- **Tag:** release

### How to Run Locally

To run the application locally using Docker, use the following commands:

```bash
docker pull erna67/devops-webapp:release
docker run -p 3000:3000 erna67/devops-webapp:release
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.


# Assignment 2 - Kubernetes

For utilizing a local Kubernetes cluster, I have used Minikube, as I already had it installed on my machine. 

## Deploy the containerized app on local K8s cluster

The following steps were taken to deploy the application on Minikube:

1. **Start Minikube:**
    ```bash
    minikube start
    ```

2. **Create a Kubernetes service:** see `k8s/deployment.yaml`

3. **Apply the deployment:**
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
    ```
   
4. Verify that the deployment is running:
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods
    
    NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    devops-webapp-deployment-d7b6b98c7-69n5m   1/1     Running   0          2m6s
    devops-webapp-deployment-d7b6b98c7-727tn   1/1     Running   0          2m6s
    devops-webapp-deployment-d7b6b98c7-fhg7c   1/1     Running   0          2m6s
    ```
   
5. **Create a Service to expose the application**
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
    ```
   
6. **Verify that the service is running:**
    ```bash
    kubectl get services
    ```
   
7. **Access the application:** Minikube provides a convenient command to access services.
   This command will automatically open your web browser to access the application using the correct Minikube IP and port:
    ```bash
    minikube service devops-webapp-service
    ```
   We can also see that the app is running and available on those addresses:
    ```bash
    |-----------|-----------------------|-------------|---------------------------|
    | default   | devops-webapp-service |          80 | http://192.168.49.2:30407 |
    |-----------|-----------------------|-------------|---------------------------|
    * Starting tunnel for service devops-webapp-service.
    |-----------|-----------------------|-------------|------------------------|
    | NAMESPACE |         NAME          | TARGET PORT |          URL           |
    |-----------|-----------------------|-------------|------------------------|
    | default   | devops-webapp-service |             | http://127.0.0.1:53312 |
    |-----------|-----------------------|-------------|------------------------|
    * Opening service default/devops-webapp-service in default browser...
   ```
